Hi my name is Nash and i'm a student at Hocking college for Cybersecurity and Networking systems. Prior to starting at Hocking I had no real knowledge or experience within the IT world let alone Cybersecurity. I've always loved electronics since I was a child always but never really thought about diving deeper into it until more recently. I'm exctied to learn and show off my new skills as they devlope. Feel free to check out my Cyber playbook repository and see for yourself!
